# Web3 Encryption Experiments

Encryption is a very powerful tool in Web3, as it allows distributed parties to communicate sensitive information over untrusted or public channels. In particular, it can be applied to Safe multisig smart accounts in order to allow signers to communicate transaction details and signatures among themselves, without revealing any information about the transaction before it is executed.

This repository serves as a small playground to try out existing encryption and decryption schemes in Web3 in order to have a better understanding of how they work as well as their limitations. This will help inform us on how to design an encrypted transaction queue for the Safe smart account.
